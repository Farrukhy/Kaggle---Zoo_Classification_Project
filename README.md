# Kaggle---Zoo_Classification_Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify animals into different categories based on their characteristics. 
The dataset contains various features that describe animals, such as whether they have hair, feathers, lay eggs, and more.
The goal is to predict the class type of an animal based on these features

Dataset Overview:
Features:
animal_name: The name of the animal.
hair: Binary feature indicating whether the animal has hair (1: Yes, 0: No).
feathers: Binary feature indicating the presence of feathers (1: Yes, 0: No).
eggs: Indicates whether the animal lays eggs (1: Yes, 0: No).
milk: Indicates whether the animal produces milk (1: Yes, 0: No).
airborne: Whether the animal can fly (1: Yes, 0: No).
aquatic: Whether the animal lives in water (1: Yes, 0: No).
predator: Whether the animal is a predator (1: Yes, 0: No).
toothed: Indicates the presence of teeth (1: Yes, 0: No).
backbone: Whether the animal has a backbone (1: Yes, 0: No).
breathes: Whether the animal breathes air (1: Yes, 0: No).
venomous: Indicates if the animal is venomous (1: Yes, 0: No).
fins: Whether the animal has fins (1: Yes, 0: No).
legs: The number of legs the animal has.
tail: Indicates the presence of a tail (1: Yes, 0: No).
domestic: Whether the animal is domesticated (1: Yes, 0: No).
catsize: Indicates whether the animal is similar in size to a house cat (1: Yes, 0: No).
Target:
class_type: The classification of the animal (e.g., mammal, bird, fish, etc.).

Objectives:
Preprocess the dataset, including handling categorical features and missing values.
Train a machine learning model to predict the animal class based on the features.
Evaluate the model using various performance metrics.
