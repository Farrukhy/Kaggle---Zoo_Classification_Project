# Kaggle---Zoo_Classification_Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify animals into different categories based on their characteristics. 
The dataset contains various features that describe animals, such as whether they have hair, feathers, lay eggs, and more.
The goal is to predict the class type of an animal based on these features
## Zoo Classification Project

This project classifies animals based on their characteristics,using machine learning techniques.
The dataset is from the [Zoo Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/zoo-animal-classification)
available on Kaggle.
- **Source**: Kaggle (Zoo Dataset)
- **Size**: 101 instances, 17 features
